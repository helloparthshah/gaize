# gaize
We at Gaize are committed to help our users in variety of fields using eye tracking techniques. By using various machine learning algorithms we came up with a solution to increase the efficiency of our users in daily activities. Our software can also be used in several other fields such as online examination, conducting research etc.

Currently, our website showcases the use of our software by giving the users points based on the efficiency of their driving. Firstly, the user needs to train the software by visiting the Train tab and following the instructions there. They can then check their driving efficiency in the Implementation tab.

Collect data points by moving your mouse over the screen, following the cursor with your eyes and hitting the space key repeatedly. Once you have enought data points (We recommend >20), hit the Train button and wait till it finishes training. The grey circle should start following your eyes around. You can continue pressing space to gather more data points (more the merrier). Once you're satisfied with your results, head on to the Implementation tab to check out one of the demo applications we created.
## Inspiration
One of our teammate's friend was involved in a major accident as he was using is phone while driving. Our team saddened after hearing the news were determined to create something that would make the use of current more efficient. That's when we were struck by the idea to create a software that would notify the driver if he/she is looking outside a certain field of view for a certain amount of time. 
## What it does
Currently, our website showcases the use of our software by giving the users points based on the efficiency of their driving. Firstly, the user needs to train the software by visiting the Train tab and following the instructions there. They can then check their driving efficiency in the Implementation tab.
## How we built it
We built Gaize by making an eye tracking algorithm using javascript. We created various machine learning algorithms to track eye movements. Our algorithm is also capable of adapting to different users as it is trained first before using.
## Challenges we ran into
We had a hard time collaborating with our teammates as we were in different time zones. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of teaming up with strangers and creating a working project within a span of two days.
## What we learned
We learned to create a website and to combine all the code together. We also gained knowledge in the field of machine learning and AI.
## What's next for Gaize
Our website showcases one of many helps that Gaize can provide. On a larger scale, we plan to implement Gaize on various platforms. One of the fields that we really look forward to working on is public speaking. We can help our users to develop their public speaking skills by tracking their eye movements. Some other fields include online examinations and research.
